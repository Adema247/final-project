# Adema's Beauty Shop — Final Project

Local static project for a small beauty shop demo.

## Features
- Responsive layout (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Right-side burger menu with profile, theme switch, cities, date/time
- Light / Dark mode (saved in localStorage)
- Authentication (Sign Up / Log In) stored in localStorage (nick, name, phone, email, password)
- Profile page showing avatar, nick, name, phone, email, cart count
- Cart stored per-user in localStorage; "Buy" button adds item and plays a sound
- Ratings under each product saved in localStorage
- Form validation (email, phone +7, password length, required)
- Search on catalog (saved)
- External Makeup API integration (catalog page)
- FAQ on brands page

## How to use
1. Place files in a static web host or open `index.html` locally.
2. For GitHub Pages: push to repository and enable Pages.

## Security note
This is a demo. Storing passwords in localStorage is insecure — use a backend for production.
